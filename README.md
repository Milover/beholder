OCR testing with [tesseract][tesseract] and [OpenCV][opencv].
The goal is to build a dot matrix printout reader for industrial quality
control purposes.

Exploratory phase currently, we're interested in the processing speed,
OCR accuracy, OCR retraining possibilities and the like.

The end product should be able to process an image in under 30ms with
an accuracy of ~99%.
